We used to be number ten
Now we permanent one
In the battle lost my finger, mic became my arm
Pistol nozzle hits your nasal, blood becomes lukewarm
Tell the woman be easy naah squeeze the charmin'
Test Wyclef, see death flesh get scorned
Beat you so bad make you feel like you ain't wanna be born
And tell your friends stay the hell out of my lawn
Chicken George became dead George stealin' chickens from my farm
Damn, another dead pigeon
If you're mafiosos, then I'm bringin' on Haitian Sicilians
Nobody's shootin', my body's made of hand grenade
Girl bled to death while she was tongue kissing a razor blade
That sounds sick maybe one day I'll write the horror
Blackula comes to the ghetto, jacks an Acura
Stevie Wonder sees crack babies becoming enemies of their own families
Armageddon come you know we soon done
Gun by my side just in case I gotta run
A boy on the side of Babylon, trying to front like he's down with
Mount Zion (yeah)
Ooh la la la
It's the way that we rock when we're doing our thing
Ooh la la la
It's the natural law that the refugees bring
Ooh la la la la la la lalala la lah
Sweet thing (yeah)
She love me like she never before, ayy
Yeah in saloons we drink Boone's and battle goons till high noon
Bust rap toons on flat spoons, take no shorts like poon poon's
See hoochies pop coochies, for Gucci's and Lucci
Find me in my Mitsubishi, eatin' sushi, bumpin' fugees
Hey hey hey
Try to take the crew and we don't play play
Say say say
Like Paul McCartney, not hardly
Oddly enough
I can see right through your bluff
They huff and they puff but they can't handle us, we bust
'Cause we fortified, I could never hide, seen "Cooley high"
Cried when Cochise died
I'm twisted, black listed by some others
Don't remove my Polos on the first episode
Ha ha you shouldn't diss refugees, and
Ha ha ha ha, you whole sound set's bootie, and
Ha ha ha ha, you have to respect Jersey, 'cause I'm superfly when
I'm super-high on the fu-gee-la
Ooh la la la
It's the way that we rock when we're doing our thing
Ooh la la la
It's the natural law that the refugees bring
Ooh la la la la la la lalala la lah
Sweet thing
Yeah, Yeah (yeah, yeah)
She love me like she never before, ayy
I sit ninety degrees underneath palm trees
Smokin' beadies as I burn my calories
Brooklyn roof tops become Brooklyn teepee
Who that be, enemies, wanna see the death of me
From Hawaii to Hawthorne, I run marathons, like
Buju Banton, I'm a true champion, like
Farakkhan reads his daily Qu'ran it's a phenomenon
Lyrics fast like Ramadan
What's goin' on
Armageddon come you know we soon done
Gun by my side just in case I gotta run
A boy on the side of Babylon, trying to front like he's down with
Mount Zion
What's goin' on
Armageddon come you know we soon done
Gun by my side just in case I gotta run
A boy on the side of babylon, trying to front like he's down with
Mount Zion
Ooh la la la
It's the way that we rock when we're doing our thing
Ooh la la la
It's the natural Law that the Refugees bring
Ooh la la la la la la lalala la lah, sweet thing
She love me like she never before, ayy
Ooh la la la
It's the way that we rock when we're doing our thing
Ooh la la la
It's the natural law that the refugees bring
Ooh la la la la la la lalala la lah, sweet thing
Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
She love me like she never before, ayy
